## Resources Used
For my password length selector, I found a couple of very helpful articles. 

The first one is https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/build-a-configurable-random-password-generator-with-javascript--cms-93262

I didn't use everything that the author shared, but I was able to create the basic functions for my password generator. 

The second article is https://css-tricks.com/value-bubbles-for-range-inputs/

I didn't end up using the methods that it shared but I decided to include a link nonetheless.
